## ✨ What Can You Do with This App?

Inside the app, you will experience a complete digital filter workflow:

### 🧠 1. **Learn the Theory**
- Built-in educational content with intuitive visual aids.
- Compare FIR and IIR filters and understand their characteristics.

### 🛠️ 2. **Design Custom Filters**
- Choose from popular filter types: **Butterworth**, **Chebyshev I & II**, **Elliptic**, and **Bessel**.
- Select your desired response type: **Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, Band-Stop**.
- Set critical parameters: filter order, cutoff frequencies, ripple, attenuation, etc.

### 📈 3. **Visualize Everything Instantly**
- Frequency Response (Magnitude & Phase)
- Impulse and Step Responses
- Pole-Zero Plots
- Group Delay (for phase analysis)

### 🎧 4. **Apply Filters to Signals**
- Generate synthetic test signals using sinusoids.
- Upload your own audio file (e.g. `.wav`) or use a sample.
- Hear the filtered signal in real-time (via Streamlit audio).
- Inspect the **before vs after** waveform and spectra.

### 📊 5. **Compare Filters Side-by-Side**
- Use the Filter Comparison tab to analyze multiple filters at once.
- Gain insights into trade-offs between different designs.
